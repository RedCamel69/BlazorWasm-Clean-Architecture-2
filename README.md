# BlazorWasm-Clean-Architecture-1

An initial look at structuring a Blazor Wasm solution according to the requirements of clean architecture. This introductory example does not implement CQRS or utilise MediatR.

 
## Usage/Examples

Delete Migrations folder in the Infrastructure project and create a new initial migration, which will contain the entire current schema.

Set the WebAPI and WebAssembly projects in the Presentation solution folder to run on start up.

Hopefully good to go!
